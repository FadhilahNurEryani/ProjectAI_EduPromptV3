# Fixes Applied

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Missing Files
- ✅ Recreated `app/layout.tsx` that was deleted
- ✅ Created `next-env.d.ts` for Next.js type definitions

### 2. TypeScript Type Fixes
- ✅ Fixed type definitions in `app/(dashboard)/generate/page.tsx`
  - Changed `variables: any` to `variables: Record<string, string> | null`
  - Added proper type casting for variables
- ✅ Fixed type definitions in `lib/auth/config.ts`
  - Added proper NextAuth type extensions
  - Fixed JWT and Session callback types
- ✅ Fixed type definitions in API routes:
  - `app/api/prompts/generate/route.ts` - Added request body types
  - `app/api/prompts/route.ts` - Added request body types and fixed where clause
  - `app/api/favorites/route.ts` - Added request body types
  - `app/api/templates/route.ts` - Fixed where clause types
  - `app/(dashboard)/library/page.tsx` - Fixed where clause types

### 3. Package.json Updates
- ✅ Added `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to devDependencies (they were missing)

### 4. TypeScript Config
- ✅ Updated `tsconfig.json` to include types directory

### 5. Component Fixes
- ✅ Fixed `components/ui/label.tsx` - Removed dependency on @radix-ui/react-label (using native label instead)
- ✅ Fixed `components/layouts/dashboard-layout.tsx` - Fixed sidebar layout with proper flex structure

## ⚠️ Remaining Issues (Will be resolved after npm install)

### TypeScript Errors
Most TypeScript errors are due to missing node_modules. These will be resolved after running:
```bash
npm install
```

The errors include:
- Cannot find module 'react' - Will be fixed after npm install
- Cannot find module 'next' - Will be fixed after npm install
- JSX element implicitly has type 'any' - Will be fixed after npm install

### CSS Warnings
The Tailwind CSS warnings in `app/globals.css` are normal and expected. They appear because:
- The CSS linter doesn't recognize Tailwind directives
- These are not actual errors and won't affect functionality
- They will be processed correctly by PostCSS/Tailwind during build
